# service-desk

This project is divided between:
- service-desk
Which contains an Ionic App with all the front-end stuff
- service-desk-api w
Which uses express to call a MariaDB database running with maria-db-server in Ubuntu.

> Both communicates to generate login pages and CRUDs accross the database.

This project was created to a Mobile course in my IFSC graduation.
It essentially is different from original project that used XAMPP and a php api but its better with modern packages, structure and a bit more interesting for me.

Github's codespaces needs that we public the port of the service-desk-api everytime npm start runs, that is the only downside of this application :(
